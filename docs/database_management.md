## Database Management System

## Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

The code has been refactored to better adhere to SRP:

1. **DatabaseManager**: Acts as a facade, delegating specific responsibilities to other classes.
2. **DatabaseConnection**: Handles database connection and basic query execution.
3. **QueryExecutor**: Focuses on executing queries.
4. **OperationRegistry**: Manages registration and retrieval of operations.

This separation ensures that each class has a single, well-defined responsibility.

## Separation of Concerns (SoC)
1. Data access is handled by DatabaseConnection and QueryExecutor.
2. Business logic is managed in the controllers (e.g., AccountsController, CategoriesController).
3. UI elements are not present in this backend code, indicating proper separation.

## DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
1. Common database operations are centralized in DatabaseConnection and QueryExecutor.
2. The OperationRegistry allows for reusable operations across the application.

## Efficiency
1. Use of SQLite for database operations, which is lightweight and efficient for local storage.
2. Proper use of parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection and improve performance.

## Code Organization
1. **Configs**: Contains path configurations (path_config.py).
2. **Controllers**: Houses database operations and specific controllers.
3. **Utils**: Includes utility functions like schema_utils.py.

## Additional Information
1. **Error Handling**: The code includes error handling and logging, which is crucial for debugging and maintaining the application.

2. **Flexibility**: The use of a schema file (SCHEMA_PATH) allows for easy database structure modifications.

3. **Initialization**: The DatabaseInitializer class provides a clean way to set up the database and register operations.

4. **Environment Variables**: The use of dotenv for configuration management is a good practice for maintaining different environments.

5. **Type Hinting**: The code uses type hints, improving readability and allowing for better IDE support.

# Usage of the database management system

## EntityController (common/entity_controller.py)
This class serves as a base controller for entity operations and uses the database management system correctly:

1. It initializes with `db_ops` and `table_name`, which are used consistently throughout the methods.
2. The `_get_columns_from_schema` method reads the schema file to dynamically determine table columns, promoting flexibility.
3. CRUD operations (add, get, update, remove) use the `db_ops` methods for query execution.
4. Error handling and logging are implemented throughout.

## SettingsTabController (tab_operations/settings_tab_operations.py)
This controller properly uses the database management system through the `db_manager`:

1. It initializes with `db_manager` and uses its operations (accounts_ops, categories_ops, expenses_ops) for all database interactions.
2. Methods like `get_category_tree`, `get_accounts`, and `get_expenses` correctly delegate to the appropriate database operations.
3. CRUD operations for accounts, categories, and expenses are properly implemented using the respective database operations.

## AccountsController (settings_tab_controllers/accounts_controller.py)
This controller extends `EntityController` and uses the database system correctly:

1. It uses `get_table_name_by_prefix` to dynamically get the table name, promoting flexibility.
2. The `get_account_by_name` method uses `db_ops.fetch_one` for querying, which is correct.

## CategoriesController (settings_tab_controllers/categories_controller.py)
This controller also extends `EntityController` and uses the database system properly:

1. It uses `get_table_name_by_prefix` for the table name.
2. The `get_category_tree` method uses `get_entities` from the base class to fetch all categories and then processes them in memory to create the tree structure.

## ExpensesController (settings_tab_controllers/expenses_controller.py)
This controller demonstrates advanced usage of the database management system:

1. It extends `EntityController` and uses `get_table_name_by_prefix` for the table name.
2. The `_ensure_indexes` method creates database indexes, which is good for performance.
3. It implements pagination in `get_expenses`, which is important for handling large datasets.
4. Methods like `get_expenses_by_category` and `get_expenses_by_date_range` show proper use of parameterized queries.
5. Error handling and logging are consistently implemented.
