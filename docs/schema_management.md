## Schema Management System

### Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

1. **SchemaController**: Acts as a facade, coordinating schema-related operations.
2. **SchemaReader**: Handles reading and parsing the schema file.
3. **TableInfoExtractor**: Focuses on extracting detailed information from table definitions.
4. **SchemaValidator**: Manages schema validation and comparison.
5. **SchemaApplier**: Handles the application of schema changes.
6. **DatabaseBackup**: Manages database backup operations.

This separation ensures that each class has a single, well-defined responsibility.

### Separation of Concerns (SoC)

1. Schema file reading is handled by SchemaReader.
2. Table information extraction is managed by TableInfoExtractor.
3. Schema validation and comparison are handled by SchemaValidator.
4. Schema changes are applied by SchemaApplier.
5. Database backup is managed by DatabaseBackup.

### DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)

1. Common schema operations are centralized in their respective classes.
2. The SchemaController delegates to specialized classes, avoiding code duplication.

### Efficiency

1. Use of regular expressions for parsing schema definitions.
2. Efficient comparison of schema and database structures.

### Code Organization

1. **SchemaController**: Main entry point for schema management operations.
2. **Schema Controller Modules**: Specialized classes for specific schema-related tasks.

### Additional Information

1. **Error Handling**: The code includes error handling and logging, crucial for debugging and maintaining the application.
2. **Flexibility**: The use of a schema file allows for easy database structure modifications.
3. **Version Control**: The system includes methods to manage and update schema versions.
4. **Backup Functionality**: Includes a method to create database backups before making significant changes.

### Usage of the Schema Management System

#### SchemaController

This class serves as the main interface for schema management:

1. It initializes with `db_ops` and creates instances of specialized classes.
2. Provides methods for table and column information retrieval.
3. Offers schema validation and comparison functionality.
4. Manages the application of schema changes.
5. Handles database backup operations.

#### SchemaReader

Responsible for reading and parsing the schema file:

1. Reads the schema file from a configured path.
2. Provides methods to extract CREATE TABLE statements and table names.

#### TableInfoExtractor

Extracts detailed information from table definitions:

1. Parses column information including name, type, and constraints.
2. Extracts foreign key information from table definitions.

#### SchemaValidator

Handles schema validation and comparison:

1. Compares schema tables with actual database tables.
2. Validates column definitions between schema and database.
3. Generates detailed reports of schema differences.

#### SchemaApplier

Manages the application of schema changes:

1. Creates missing tables based on schema definitions.
2. Adds missing columns to existing tables.
3. Updates the schema version after successful changes.

#### DatabaseBackup

Handles database backup operations:

1. Creates a backup of the current database to a specified path.
2. Provides error handling and logging for backup operations.

This schema management system provides a robust and flexible way to manage database schemas, ensuring data integrity and facilitating easy database structure updates.
